## What's EARTH?

EARTH is a project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet.

- EARTH Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability and high-throughput support that underlies all the decentralized applications in the EARTH ecosystem.

- EARTH Virtual Machine (TVM) allow anyone to develop decentralized applications (DAPPs) for themselves or their communities with smart contracts thereby making decentralized crowdfunding and token issuance easier than ever.

EARTH enables large-scale development and engagement. With over 2000 transactions per second (TPS), high concurrency, low latency and massive data transmission. It is ideal for building decentralized entertainment applications. Free features and incentive systems allow developers to create premium app experiences for users.
